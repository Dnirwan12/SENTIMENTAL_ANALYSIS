# SENTIMENTAL_ANALYSIS
It's a sentimental analysis work with numpy and tensorflow and we feed local emotions and accordingly it gives the output.

**SENTIMENTAL_ANALYSIS**
Overview

SENTIMENTAL_ANALYSIS is a Python project designed to perform sentiment analysis using TensorFlow and NumPy. This tool analyzes text input to determine the underlying sentiment, whether positive, negative, or neutral, based on the emotional content of the input. The sentiment analysis model is trained on local emotion datasets and uses advanced machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions.

**Features**
Sentiment Classification: Classify text into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.
Local Emotion Integration: Trained on a dataset of locally sourced emotions to improve relevance and accuracy for specific contexts.
TensorFlow Backend: Utilizes TensorFlow for building and training the sentiment analysis model.
NumPy Support: Leverages NumPy for numerical operations and data handling.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+: The project is compatible with Python versions 3.7 and above.
TensorFlow: Required for machine learning and model training.
NumPy: Used for numerical operations and data manipulation.
Pandas (optional but recommended): Useful for handling and analyzing data.
You can install the required packages using pip:

**CODE**
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas
Installation
Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
**CODE**
cd SENTIMENTAL_ANALYSIS
Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Python packages:

 **CODE**
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Preparing Data
Before using the model, you need to prepare your data. The data should be in a format compatible with the model. Here’s a simple example of how to prepare and load data:

Prepare Your Dataset

Create a CSV file with two columns: text and label. The text column contains the text data, and the label column contains the sentiment labels.

Load the Dataset

Use the provided utility functions to load and preprocess your data:

python
Copy code
from data_preprocessing import load_data

# Load the dataset
data = load_data('path_to_your_data.csv')
Training the Model
Train the sentiment analysis model using your dataset. The following script demonstrates how to train the model:

python
Copy code
from model_training import train_model

#  parameters
epochs = 10
batch_size = 32

# Train the model
train_model(data, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size)
Predicting Sentiments
Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the sentiment of new text data:

python
Copy code
from sentiment_predictor import predict_sentiment

# Predict sentiment
text = "I love this product!"
sentiment = predict_sentiment(text)
print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}")
Evaluating the Model
Evaluate the performance of your model using test data:

python
Copy code
from model_evaluation import evaluate_model

# Evaluate the model
evaluation_results = evaluate_model(test_data)
print(evaluation_results)
Folder Structure
The project has the following folder structure:

data_preprocessing.py: Contains functions for loading and preprocessing data.
model_training.py: Includes functions for training the sentiment analysis model.
sentiment_predictor.py: Provides functions for predicting sentiment of new text.
model_evaluation.py: Contains functions for evaluating the model’s performance.
requirements.txt: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
